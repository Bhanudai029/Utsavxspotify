2. Use the Firebase Upload Test component to test image uploads
3. Select any image file and click "Test Firebase Upload"
4. Monitor the console for detailed logging

### Step 4: Use Normal Song Upload
1. Click **"Add New Song"** 
2. Fill in song details
3. Upload image (it will use the same Firebase system)
4. Add audio URL from Supabase
5. Save the song

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration Used
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCgh68CuqHxzmIlV6VRcc2W4BYFXP4ZNQk",
  authDomain: "music-x-dfd87.firebaseapp.com", 
  projectId: "music-x-dfd87",
  storageBucket: "music-x-dfd87.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "600929755806",
  appId: "1:600929755806:web:3e11645bd94118854618f", // ✅ Updated App ID
  measurementId: "G-QNP4BFQ9ZM"
};
```

## 📝 Firebase Storage Rules Needed

Deploy these rules to your Firebase Storage:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow all users to read images
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Song images - allow upload for all users 
    match /song-images/{imageId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
      allow create: if request.resource.size < 15 * 1024 * 1024 &&
                       request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
    
    // Test uploads for Firebase testing
    match /test-uploads/{imageId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
      allow create: if request.resource.size < 15 * 1024 * 1024 &&
                       request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Upload Fails:
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Firebase Rules**: Make sure storage rules allow public uploads
3. **Check Network**: Ensure stable internet connection  
4. **Try Different Image**: Some images may have metadata issues
5. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes cached auth tokens cause issues

### Common Issues:
- **"Access Denied"**: Firebase storage rules need to be updated
- **"Upload Stalled at 20%"**: Usually authentication or network issues - the system has fallback strategies
- **"Invalid Format"**: Only JPEG, PNG, WebP images are supported
- **"File Too Large"**: Images are automatically compressed, but very large files may still fail

## ⚡ Features Available:

### Image Upload System:
- ✅ Automatic image compression
- ✅ Custom crop functionality (1:1 ratio for songs)
- ✅ Three-strategy fallback upload system
- ✅ Detailed progress tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Real-time upload monitoring

### File Format Support:
- ✅ JPEG, PNG, WebP images
- ✅ Automatic format optimization
- ✅ Size validation (up to 15MB)
- ✅ Metadata preservation

## 📊 Expected Upload Flow:
1. **File Selection**: Choose image file
2. **Validation**: Check format and size  
3. **Compression**: Automatic optimization if needed
4. **Cropping**: Custom 1:1 crop for song images
5. **Upload**: Three-strategy fallback system
   - Strategy 1: Normal authenticated upload
   - Strategy 2: Simple upload
   - Strategy 3: Public upload (no auth required)
6. **Verification**: URL accessibility check
7. **Storage**: Save metadata to Firestore

The system is designed to be robust and should handle most common upload scenarios automatically.
